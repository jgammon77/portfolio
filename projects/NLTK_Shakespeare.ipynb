            "THE by From we desire increase That thereby rose might never die But as the riper should by time decease His tender heir might bear his memory But thou contracted to thine own bright thy flame with fuel Making a famine where abundance Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel Thou that art now the fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring Within thine own bud thy content And tender churl waste in Pity the world or else this glutton be To eat the due by the grave and thee When forty shall besiege thy brow And dig deep in thy field Thy livery so on now Will be a tattered weed of small worth Then being where all thy beauty Where all the treasure of thy lusty days To say within thine own deep sunken Were an shame and thriftless praise How much more praise deserved thy use If thou answer This fair child of mine Shall sum my count and make my old excuse Proving his beauty by succession thine This were to be new made when thou art old And see thy blood warm when thou it cold Look in thy glass and tell the face thou Now is the time that face should form another Whose fresh repair if now thou not Thou beguile the world unbless some mother For where is she so fair whose womb the tillage of thy husbandry Or who is he so will be the tomb Of his to stop posterity Thou art thy glass and she in thee back the lovely of her prime So thou through of thine age shalt see Despite of this thy golden time But if thou live not to be Die single and thine image with thee Unthrifty loveliness why thou spend Upon thy self thy legacy bequest nothing but lend And being frank she to those are free Then beauteous niggard why thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give Profitless usurer why thou use So great a sum of yet not live For traffic with thy self alone Thou of thy self thy sweet self deceive Then how when nature thee to be gone What acceptable audit thou leave Thy unused beauty must be with thee Which used th executor to be Those that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye dwell Will play the to the very same And that unfair which fairly excel For time summer on To hideous winter and him there Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone Beauty and bareness every where Then were not distillation left A liquid prisoner pent in of glass effect with beauty were bereft Nor it nor no remembrance what it was But distilled though they with winter meet but their show their substance still sweet Then let not ragged hand deface In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place With treasure ere it be That use is not forbidden usury Which those that pay the willing loan Thats for thy self to breed another thee Or ten times happier be it ten for one Ten times thy self were happier than thou art If ten of thine ten times thee Then what could death do if thou depart Leaving thee living in posterity Be not for thou art much too fair To be conquest and make thine heir Lo in the orient when the gracious light up his burning head each under eye homage to his sight Serving with his sacred majesty And the heavenly hill strong youth in his middle age Yet mortal adore his beauty still on his golden pilgrimage But when from highmost pitch with weary car Like feeble age he from the day The fore duteous now converted are From his low tract and look another way So thou thy self outgoing in thy noon Unlooked on unless thou get a son Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly with war not joy in joy Why thou that which thou not gladly Or else with pleasure thine annoy If the true concord of By married do offend thine ear They do but sweetly chide thee who In singleness the that thou bear Mark how one string sweet husband to another each in each by mutual sire and child and happy mother Who all in one one pleasing note do sing Whose speechless song being many seeming one this to thee Thou single wilt prove none Is it for fear to wet a eye That thou thy self in single life Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die The world will wail thee like a wife The world will be thy widow and still weep That thou no form of thee left behind When every private widow well may keep By her shape in mind Look what an unthrift in the world spend but his place for still the world it But waste hath in the world an end And kept unused the user so it No love toward in that bosom That on himself such shame For shame deny that thou love to any Who for thy self art so unprovident Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many But that thou none is most evident For thou art so possessed with hate That gainst thy self thou not to conspire Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire O change thy thought that I may change my mind Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love Be as thy presence is gracious and kind Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove Make thee another self for love of me That beauty still may live in thine or thee As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou In one of thine from that which thou And that fresh blood which youngly thou Thou call thine when thou from youth Herein wisdom beauty and increase Without this folly age and cold decay If all were minded so the times should cease And threescore year would make the world away Let those whom nature hath not made for store Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish Look whom she best she gave thee more Which bounteous gift thou in bounty cherish She thee for her seal and meant thereby Thou print more not let that copy die When I do count the clock that the time And see the brave day sunk in hideous night When I behold the violet past prime And sable all silvered oer with white When lofty I see barren of leaves Which from heat did canopy the herd And green all up in Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard Then of thy beauty do I question make That thou among the of time must go Since and do themselves forsake And die as fast as they see grow And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence Save breed to brave him when he thee hence O that you were your self but love you are No longer yours than you your self here live Against this coming end you should prepare And your sweet semblance to some other give So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination then you were Your self again after your decease When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear Who so fair a house fall to decay Which husbandry in might uphold Against the stormy of day And barren rage of eternal cold O none but dear my love you know You had a father let your son say so Not from the do I my pluck And yet methinks I have astronomy But not to tell of good or evil luck Of of or quality Nor can I fortune to brief tell Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind Or say with if it shall go well By oft predict that I in heaven find But from thine my knowledge I derive And constant in them I read such art As truth and beauty shall together thrive If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert Or else of thee this I prognosticate Thy end is and doom and date When I consider every thing that in perfection but a little moment That this huge stage nought but Whereon the in secret influence comment When I perceive that men as increase Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease And wear their brave state out of memory Then the conceit of this inconstant stay you most rich in youth before my sight Where wasteful time with decay To change your day of youth to night And all in war with Time for love of you As he from you I engraft you new But wherefore do not you a way Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time And fortify your self in your decay With more blessed than my barren rhyme Now stand you on the top of happy And many maiden yet unset With virtuous wish would bear you living Much liker than your painted counterfeit So should the of life that life repair Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen Neither in inward worth nor outward fair Can make you live your self in of men To give away your self your self still And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill Who will believe my verse in time to come If it were filled with your most high Though yet heaven it is but as a tomb Which your life and not half your If I could write the beauty of your And in fresh number all your The age to come would say this poet Such heavenly neer touched earthly So should my with their age Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue And your true be a rage And of an antique song But were some child of yours alive that time You should live twice in it and in my rhyme Shall I compare thee to a day Thou art more lovely and more temperate Rough do shake the darling of May And lease hath all too short a date Sometime too hot the eye of heaven And often is his gold complexion dimmed And every fair from fair sometime By chance or course untrimmed But thy eternal summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou Nor shall death brag thou in his shade When in eternal to time thou So long as men can breathe or can see So long this and this life to thee Devouring Time blunt thou the And make the earth devour her own sweet brood Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce And burn the phoenix in her blood Make glad and sorry as thou And do thou wilt Time To the wide world and all her fading But I forbid thee one most heinous crime O carve not with thy my fair brow Nor draw no there with thine antique pen Him in thy course untainted do allow For pattern to succeeding men Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong My love shall in my verse ever live young A face with own hand painted thou the master mistress of my passion A gentle heart but not acquainted With shifting change as is false fashion An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling Gilding the object whereupon it A man in hue all in his Which and And for a woman wert thou first Till nature as she wrought thee fell And by addition me of thee By one thing to my purpose nothing But since she pricked thee out for pleasure Mine be thy love and thy use their treasure So is it not with me as with that muse by a painted beauty to his verse Who heaven it self for ornament use And every fair with his fair rehearse Making a couplement of compare With sun and moon with earth and rich With and all rare That heavens air in this huge rondure O let me true in love but truly write And then believe me my love is as fair As any child though not so bright As those gold fixed in heavens air Let them say more that like of hearsay well I will not praise that purpose not to sell My glass shall not persuade me I am old So long as youth and thou are of one date But when in thee times I behold Then look I death my days should expiate For all that beauty that cover thee Is but the seemly raiment of my heart Which in thy breast live as thine in me How can I then be elder than thou art O therefore love be of thyself so wary As I not for my self but for thee will Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary As tender nurse her babe from faring ill Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain Thou me thine not to give back again As an unperfect actor on the stage Who with his fear is put beside his part Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage Whose abundance his own heart So I for fear of trust forget to say The perfect ceremony of rite And in mine own strength seem to decay with of mine own might O let my be then the eloquence And dumb of my speaking breast Who plead for love and look for recompense More than that tongue that more hath more expressed O learn to read what silent love hath writ To hear with to fine wit Mine eye hath the painter and hath Thy form in table of my heart My body is the frame wherein And perspective it is best art For through the painter must you see his skill To find where your true image pictured Which in my shop is hanging still That hath his glazed with thine Now see what good turns for have done Mine have drawn thy shape and thine for me Are to my breast wherethrough the sun to peep to gaze therein on thee Yet this cunning want to grace their art They draw but what they see know not the heart Let those who are in with their Of public and boast Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph Unlooked for joy in that I most Great their fair leaves spread But as the marigold at the eye And in themselves their pride buried For at a frown they in their glory die The painful warrior for fight After a thousand once Is from the book of quite And all the rest forgot for which he toiled Then happy I that love and am beloved Where I may not remove nor be removed Lord of my love to whom in vassalage Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit To thee I send this written embassage To witness duty not to show my wit Duty so great which wit so poor as mine May make seem bare in wanting to show it But that I hope some good conceit of thine In thy thought all naked will bestow it Till whatsoever star that my moving on me graciously with fair aspect And apparel on my tattered loving To show me worthy of thy sweet respect Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee Till then not show my head where thou prove me Weary with toil I haste me to my bed The dear for with travel tired But then a journey in my head To work my mind when works For then my from far where I abide Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee And keep my drooping open wide Looking on darkness which the blind do see Save that my imaginary sight thy shadow to my sightless view Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night black night beauteous and her old face new Lo thus by day my by night my mind For thee and for my self no quiet find How can I then return in happy plight That am the benefit of rest When days oppression is not by night But day by night and night by day oppressed And each though to reign Do in consent shake to torture me The one by toil the other to complain How far I toil still farther off from thee I tell the day to please him thou art bright And him grace when do blot the heaven So flatter I the night When sparkling twire not thou the even But day daily draw my longer And night nightly make length seem When in disgrace with Fortune and I all alone beweep my outcast state And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless And look upon my self and curse my fate Wishing me like to one more rich in hope Featured like him like him with possessed this art and that scope With what I most enjoy contented least Yet in these my self almost Haply I think on thee and then my state Like to the lark at break of day From sullen earth at heavens gate For thy sweet love such wealth That then I scorn to change my state with When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of past I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought And with old new wail my dear times waste Then can I drown an eye unused to flow For precious in dateless night And weep afresh long since woe And moan th expense of many a sight Then can I grieve at foregone And heavily from woe to woe tell oer The sad account of forebemoaned moan Which I new pay as if not before But if the while I think on thee dear friend All are and end Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts Which I by have supposed dead And there love and all loving And all those which I thought buried How many a holy and obsequious tear Hath dear religious love from mine eye As interest of the dead which now appear But removed that hidden in thee lie Thou art the grave where buried love live Hung with the of my gone Who all their of me to thee did give That due of many now is thine alone Their I I view in thee And thou all they all the all of me If thou survive my day When that churl death my with dust shall cover And shalt by fortune once more resurvey These poor rude of thy deceased lover Compare them with the of the time And though they be by every pen Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme by the height of happier men O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought Had my Muse grown with this growing age A birth than this his love had brought To march in of better equipage But since he and better prove Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye Kissing with golden face the green Gilding pale with heavenly alchemy Anon permit the to ride With ugly rack on his celestial face And from the forlorn world his visage hide Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace Even so my sun one early morn did shine With all triumphant on my brow But out alack he was but one hour mine The region cloud hath masked him from me now Yet him for this my love no whit of the world may stain when heavens sun Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day And make me travel forth without my cloak To let base me in my way thy in their rotten smoke not enough that through the cloud thou break To dry the rain on my face For no man well of such a salve can speak That the wound and not the disgrace Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief Though thou repent yet I have still the loss Th sorrow but weak relief To him that the strong cross Ah but those are pearl which thy love And they are rich and ransom all ill No more be grieved at that which thou done have and silver mud and stain both moon and sun And loathsome canker in bud All men make and even I in this thy trespass with compare My self corrupting thy amiss Excusing thy more than thy are For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense Thy adverse party is thy advocate And gainst my self a lawful plea commence Such civil war is in my love and hate That I an accessary needs must be To that sweet thief which sourly from me Let me confess that we two must be twain Although our undivided are one So shall those that do with me remain Without thy help by me be borne alone In our two there is but one respect Though in our a separable spite Which though it alter not sole effect Yet it steal sweet from delight I may not evermore acknowledge thee Lest my guilt should do thee shame Nor thou with public kindness me Unless thou take that from thy name But do not so I love thee in such sort As thou being mine mine is thy good report As a decrepit father delight To see his active child do of youth So I made lame by spite Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit Or any of these all or all or more in thy do crowned sit I make my love to this store So then I am not lame poor nor Whilst that this shadow such substance give That I in thy abundance am And by a part of all thy glory live Look what is best that best I wish in thee This wish I have then ten times happy me How can my muse want subject to invent While thou breathe that into my verse Thine own sweet argument too excellent For every vulgar paper to rehearse O give thy self the thanks if aught in me Worthy perusal stand against thy sight For so dumb that cannot write to thee When thou thy self give invention light Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth Than those old nine which invocate And he that on thee let him bring forth Eternal to outlive long date If my slight muse do please these curious days The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise O how thy worth with manners may I sing When thou art all the better part of me What can mine own praise to mine own self bring And what ist but mine own when I praise thee Even for this let us divided live And our dear love lose name of single one That by this separation I may give That due to thee which thou alone O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave To entertain the time with of love Which time and so sweetly deceive And that thou how to make one twain By praising him here who hence remain Take all my my love yea take them all What thou then more than thou before No love my love that thou true love call All mine was thine before thou this more Then if for my love thou my love I cannot blame thee for my love thou But yet be blamed if thou thy self By taste of what thy self I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief Although thou steal thee all my poverty And yet love it is a greater grief To bear greater wrong than known injury Lascivious grace in whom all ill well Kill me with yet we must not be Those pretty that liberty When I am sometime absent from thy heart Thy beauty and thy full well For still temptation where thou art Gentle thou art and therefore to be won Beauteous thou art therefore to be And when a woman what son Will sourly leave her till he have Ay me but yet thou my seat forbear And chide thy beauty and thy youth Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee Thine by thy beauty being false to me That thou her it is not all my grief And yet it may be said I her dearly That she hath thee is of my chief A loss in love that me more nearly Loving thus I will excuse ye Thou love her because thou I love her And for my sake even so she abuse me my friend for my sake to approve her If I lose thee my loss is my gain And losing her my friend hath found that loss Both find each other and I lose both twain And both for my sake lay on me this cross But the joy my friend and I are one Sweet flattery then she but me alone When most I wink then do mine best see For all the day they view unrespected But when I sleep in they look on thee And darkly bright are bright in dark directed Then thou whose shadow make bright How would thy form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light When to unseeing thy shade so How would I say mine be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless stay All days are nights to see till I see thee And nights bright days when do show thee me If the dull substance of my flesh were thought Injurious distance should not stop my way For then despite of space I would be brought From far remote where thou stay No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee For nimble thought can jump both sea and land As soon as think the place where he would be But ah thought me that I am not thought To leap large of when thou art gone But that so much of earth and water wrought I must attend times leisure with my moan nought by so slow But heavy of woe The other two slight air and purging fire Are both with thee wherever I abide The first my thought the other my desire These with swift motion slide For when these are gone In tender embassy of love to thee My life being made of four with two alone down to death oppressed with melancholy Until composition be By those swift returned from thee Who even but now come back again assured Of thy fair health it to me This told I joy but then no longer glad I send them back again and straight grow sad Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight Mine eye my heart thy sight would bar My heart mine eye the freedom of that right My heart plead that thou in him lie A closet never pierced with crystal But the defendant that plea deny And in him thy fair appearance To side this title is A quest of all to the heart And by their verdict is determined The clear moiety and the dear hearts part As thus mine due is thy outward part And my hearts right thy inward love of heart Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took And each good turns now unto the other When that mine eye is for a look Or heart in love with himself smother With my picture then my eye feast And to the painted banquet my heart Another time mine eye is my hearts guest And in his of love share a part So either by thy picture or my love Thy self away art present still with me For thou not farther than my move And I am still with them and they with thee Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight my heart to hearts and delight How careful was I when I took my way Each trifle under to thrust That to my use it might unused stay From of falsehood in sure of trust But thou to whom my are Most worthy comfort now my grief Thou best of and mine only care Art left the prey of every vulgar thief Thee have I not locked up in any chest Save where thou art not though I feel thou art Within the gentle closure of my breast From whence at pleasure thou come and part And even thence thou wilt be I fear For truth thievish for a prize so dear Against that time if ever that time come When I shall see thee frown on my When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum to that audit by advised Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye When love converted from the thing it was Shall find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert And this my hand against my self uprear To guard the lawful on thy part To leave poor me thou the strength of Since why to love I can allege no cause How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek my weary end teach that case and that repose to say Thus far the are measured from thy friend The beast that me tired with my woe dully on to bear that weight in me As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider not speed being made from thee The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger into his hide Which heavily he with a groan More sharp to me than to his side For that same groan put this in my mind My grief onward and my joy behind Thus can my love excuse the slow Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed From where thou art why should I haste me thence Till I return of posting is no need O what excuse will my poor beast then find When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur though mounted on the wind In winged speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire of love being made Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race But love for love thus shall excuse my jade Since from thee going he went Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go So am I as the rich whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet treasure The which he will not every hour survey For the fine point of seldom pleasure Therefore are so solemn and so rare Since seldom coming in that long year set Like of worth they thinly are Or captain in the carcanet So is the time that you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe hide To make some special instant By new unfolding his pride Blessed are you whose worthiness scope Being had to triumph being to hope What is your substance whereof are you made That millions of strange on you tend Since every one hath every one one shade And you but one can every shadow lend Describe and the counterfeit Is poorly after you On cheek all art of beauty set And you in are painted new Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one shadow of your beauty show The other as your bounty appear And you in every blessed shape we know In all external grace you have some part But you like none none you for constant heart O how much more beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth give The rose fair but fairer we it deem For that sweet which in it live The canker have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the on such and play as wantonly When breath their masked But for their virtue only is their show They live unwooed and unrespected fade Die to themselves Sweet do not so Of their sweet are made And so of you beauteous and lovely youth When that shall vade by verse your truth Not marble nor the gilded Of shall outlive this powerful rhyme But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone with sluttish time When wasteful war shall overturn And root out the work of masonry Nor his sword nor quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory Gainst death and enmity Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room Even in the of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom So till the judgment that your self arise You live in this and dwell in Sweet love renew thy force be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite Which but today by feeding is Tomorrow in his former might So love be thou although today thou fill Thy hungry even till they wink with Tomorrow see again and do not kill The spirit of love with a perpetual Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which the shore where two contracted new Come daily to the that when they see Return of love more blest may be the view Or call it winter which being full of care welcome thrice more wished more rare Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the and times of your desire I have no precious time at all to spend Nor to do till you require Nor dare I chide the hour Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you Nor think the bitterness of absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be or your suppose But like a sad slave stay and think of nought Save where you are how happy you make those So true a fool is love that in your will Though you do any thing he no ill That god forbid that made me first your slave I should in thought control your times of pleasure Or at your hand th account of to crave Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure O let me suffer being at your beck Th absence of your liberty And patience tame to sufferance bide each check Without you of injury Be where you list your charter is so strong That you your self may your time To what you will to you it belong Your self to pardon of crime I am to wait though waiting so be hell Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well If there be nothing new but that which is Hath been before how are our brains Which for invention bear The second of a former child O that record could with a backward look Even of five hundred of the sun Show me your image in some antique book Since mind at first in character was done That I might see what the old world could say To this composed wonder of your frame Whether we are or whether better they Or whether revolution be the same O sure I am the of former days To worse have given admiring praise Like as the make towards the pebbled shore So do our hasten to their end Each place with that which goes before In sequent toil all forwards do Nativity once in the main of light to maturity wherewith being crowned Crooked gainst his glory fight And Time that gave now his gift confound Time transfix the flourish set on youth And the in brow on the of truth And nothing but for his scythe to mow And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand Is it thy will thy image should keep open My heavy to the weary night thou desire my should be broken While like to thee do mock my sight Is it thy spirit that thou from thee So far from home into my to pry To find out and idle in me The scope and tenure of thy jealousy O no thy love though much is not so great It is my love that mine eye awake Mine own true love that my rest defeat To play the watchman ever for thy sake For thee watch I whilst thou wake elsewhere From me far off with all too near Sin of all mine eye And all my soul and all my every part And for this sin there is no remedy It is so grounded inward in my heart Methinks no face so gracious is as mine No shape so true no truth of such account And for my self mine own worth do define As I all other in all surmount But when my glass me my self indeed and with tanned antiquity Mine own quite contrary I read Self so were iniquity thee my self that for my self I praise Painting my age with beauty of thy days Against my love shall be as I am now With Times injurious hand crushed and When have drained his blood and filled his brow With and when his youthful morn Hath travelled on to steepy night And all those whereof now king Are vanishing or out of sight Stealing away the treasure of his spring For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding cruel knife That he shall never cut from memory My sweet beauty though my life His beauty shall in these black be seen And they shall live and he in them still green When I have seen by Times fell hand The cost of outworn buried age When sometime lofty I see And brass eternal slave to mortal rage When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore And the firm soil win of the watery main Increasing store with loss and loss with store When I have seen such interchange of State Or state it self confounded to decay Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate That Time will come and take my love away This thought is as a death which cannot choose But weep to have that which it to lose Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea But sad mortality their power How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea Whose action is no than a flower O how shall honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of days When impregnable are not so stout Nor of steel so strong but time O fearful meditation where alack Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid O none unless this miracle have might That in black ink my love may still shine bright Tired with all these for restful death I cry As to behold desert a beggar born And needy nothing in jollity And faith unhappily forsworn And gilded shamefully And maiden virtue rudely And right perfection wrongfully And strength by limping sway disabled And art made by authority And folly doctorlike skill And simple truth simplicity And captive good captain ill Tired with all these from these would I be gone Save that to die I leave my love alone Ah wherefore with infection should he live And with his presence grace impiety That sin by him advantage should achieve And lace it self with his society Why should false painting imitate his cheek And steal dead seeming of his living hue Why should poor beauty indirectly seek of shadow since his rose is true Why should he live now nature bankrupt is of blood to blush through lively For she hath no exchequer now but his And of many upon his gains O him she to show what wealth she had In days long since before these last so bad Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn When beauty lived and as do now Before these bastard of fair were born Or durst inhabit on a living brow Before the golden of the dead The right of were shorn away To live a second life on second head Ere dead fleece made another gay In him those holy antique are seen Without all ornament it self and true Making no summer of green Robbing no old to dress his beauty new And him as for a map Nature store To show false Art what beauty was of yore Those of thee that the eye view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend All the voice of give thee that due bare truth even so as commend Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned But those same that give thee so thine own In other do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown They look into the beauty of thy mind And that in guess they measure by thy Then their although their were kind To thy fair flower add the rank smell of But why thy not thy show The soil is this that thou common grow That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect For mark was ever yet the fair The ornament of beauty is suspect A crow that in heavens air So thou be good slander but approve Thy worth the greater being of time For canker vice the love And thou a pure unstained prime Thou by the ambush of young days Either not or victor being Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise To tie up envy evermore enlarged If some suspect of ill masked not thy show Then thou alone of hearts owe No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with to dwell Nay if you read this line remember not The hand that writ it for I love you so That I in your sweet would be forgot If thinking on me then should make you woe O if I say you look upon this verse When I perhaps am with clay Do not so much as my poor name rehearse But let your love even with my life decay Lest the wise world should look into your moan And mock you with me after I am gone O lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me that you should love After my death dear love forget me quite For you in me can nothing worthy prove Unless you would devise some virtuous lie To do more for me than mine own desert And more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart O lest your true love may seem false in this That you for love speak well of me untrue My name be buried where my body is And live no more to shame nor me nor you For I am shamed by that which I bring forth And so should you to love nothing worth That time of year thou in me behold When yellow leaves or none or few do Upon those which shake against the cold Bare ruined where late the sweet sang In me thou the twilight of such day As after sunset in the west Which by and by black night take away second self that up all in rest In me thou the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his youth lie As the deathbed whereon it must expire with that which it was by This thou which thy love more strong To love that well which thou must leave ere long But be contented when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away My life hath in this line some interest Which for memorial still with thee shall stay When thou this thou review The very part was consecrate to thee The earth can have but earth which is his due My spirit is thine the better part of me So then thou but lost the dregs of life The prey of my body being dead The coward conquest of a knife Too base of thee to be The worth of that is that which it And that is this and this with thee remains So are you to my as food to life Or as are to the ground And for the peace of you I hold such strife As twixt a miser and his wealth is found Now as an enjoyer and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure Now counting best to be with you alone Then that the world may see my pleasure Sometime all full with on your sight And by and by clean starved for a look Possessing or no delight Save what is had or must from you be took Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day Or on all or all away Why is my verse so barren of new pride So far from variation or quick change Why with the time do I not glance aside To and to strange Why write I still all one ever the same And keep invention in a noted weed That every word almost tell my name Showing their birth and where they did proceed O know sweet love I always write of you And you and love are still my argument So all my best is dressing old new Spending again what is already spent For as the sun is daily new and old So is my love still telling what is told Thy glass will show thee how thy wear Thy dial how thy precious waste These vacant leaves thy imprint will bear And of this book this learning thou taste The which thy glass will truly show Of mouthed will give thee memory Thou by thy shady stealth know Times thievish progress to eternity Look what thy memory cannot contain Commit to these waste and thou shalt find Those from thy brain To take a new acquaintance of thy mind These so oft as thou wilt look Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book So oft have I thee for my muse And found such fair assistance in my verse As every alien pen hath got my use And under thee their poesy disperse Thine that taught the dumb on high to sing And heavy ignorance aloft to fly Have added to the wing And given grace a double majesty Yet be most of that which I compile Whose influence is thine and born of thee In works thou but mend the style And with thy sweet be But thou art all my art and advance As high as learning my rude ignorance Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid My verse alone had all thy gentle grace But now my gracious are decayed And my sick muse give an other place I grant sweet love thy lovely argument the travail of a pen Yet what of thee thy poet invent He thee of and it thee again He thee virtue and he stole that word From thy behaviour beauty he give And found it in thy cheek he can afford No praise to thee but what in thee live Then thank him not for that which he say Since what he thee thou thy self pay O how I faint when I of you do write Knowing a better spirit use your name And in the praise thereof all his might To make me speaking of your fame But since your worth wide as the ocean is The humble as the sail bear My saucy bark inferior far to his On your broad main appear Your help will hold me up afloat Whilst he upon your soundless deep ride Or being I am a worthless boat He of tall building and of goodly pride Then if he thrive and I be cast away The worst was this my love was my decay Or I shall live your epitaph to make Or you survive when I in earth am rotten From hence your memory death cannot take Although in me each part will be forgotten Your name from hence immortal life shall have Though I once gone to all the world must die The earth can yield me but a common grave When you in shall lie Your monument shall be my gentle verse Which not yet shall And to be your being shall rehearse When all the of this world are dead You still shall live such virtue hath my pen Where breath most even in the of men I grant thou wert not married to my muse And therefore without attaint The which use Of their fair subject blessing every book Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue Finding thy worth a limit past my praise And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some stamp of the days And do so love yet when they have What strained rhetoric can lend Thou truly fair wert truly In true plain by thy friend And their gross painting might be better used Where need blood in thee it is I never saw that you did painting need And therefore to your fair no painting set I found or thought I found you did exceed That barren tender of a debt And therefore have I slept in your report That you your self being extant well might show How far a modern quill come too short Speaking of worth what worth in you grow This silence for my sin you did impute Which shall be most my glory being dumb For I impair not beauty being mute When would give life and bring a tomb There more life in one of your fair Than both your can in praise devise Who is it that most which can say more Than this rich praise that you alone are you In whose confine is the store Which should example where your equal grew Lean penury within that pen dwell That to his subject not some small glory But he that of you if he can tell That you are you so his story Let him but copy what in you is writ Not making worse what nature made so clear And such a counterpart shall fame his wit Making his style admired every where You to your beauteous add a curse Being on praise which your worse My muse in manners her still While of your praise richly Reserve their character with golden quill And precious phrase by all the I think good whilst other write good And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen To every hymn that able spirit In polished form of well refined pen Hearing you I say so true And to the most of praise add something more But that is in my thought whose love to you Though come hindmost his rank before Then for the breath of respect Me for my dumb speaking in effect Was it the full sail of his great verse Bound for the prize of all too precious you That did my ripe in my brain inhearse Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew Was it his spirit by taught to write Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead No neither he nor his by night Giving him aid my verse He nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly him with intelligence As of my silence cannot boast I was not sick of any fear from thence But when your countenance filled up his line Then I matter that mine Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing And like enough thou thy estimate The charter of thy worth thee My in thee are all determinate For how do I hold thee but by thy And for that riches where is my deserving The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting And so my patent back again is Thy self thou thy own worth then not knowing Or me to whom thou it else mistaking So thy great gift upon misprision growing Comes home again on better making Thus have I had thee as a dream flatter In sleep a king but waking no such matter When thou shalt be disposed to set me light And place my merit in the eye of scorn Upon thy side against my self Ill fight And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn With mine own weakness being best acquainted Upon thy part I can set down a story Of concealed wherein I am That thou in losing me shalt win much glory And I by this will be a gainer too For bending all my loving on thee The that to my self I do Doing thee vantage me Such is my love to thee I so belong That for thy right my self will bear all wrong Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault And I will comment upon that Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt Against thy making no defence Thou not love disgrace me half so ill To set a form upon desired change As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will I will acquaintance strangle and look strange Be absent from thy and in my tongue Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell Lest I too much profane should do it And haply of our old acquaintance tell For thee against my self Ill vow debate For I must neer love him whom thou hate Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now Now while the world is bent my to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow And do not drop in for an afterloss Ah do not when my heart hath this sorrow Come in the rearward of a woe Give not a windy night a rainy morrow To linger out a overthrow If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last When other petty have done their spite But in the onset come so shall I taste At first the very worst of might And other of woe which now seem woe with loss of thee will not seem so Some glory in their birth some in their skill Some in their wealth some in their force Some in their though newfangled ill Some in their and some in their horse And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure Wherein it a joy above the rest But these are not my measure All these I better in one general best Thy love is better than high birth to me than wealth than Of more delight than and be And thee of all pride I boast Wretched in this alone that thou take All this away and me most make But do thy worst to steal thy self away For term of life thou art assured mine And life no longer than thy love will stay For it upon that love of thine Then need I not to fear the worst of When in the least of them my life hath end I see a better state to me Than that which on thy humour depend Thou not vex me with inconstant mind Since that my life on thy revolt lie O what a happy title do I find Happy to have thy love happy to die But whats so that no blot Thou be false and yet I know it not So shall I live supposing thou art true Like a husband so face May still seem love to me though new Thy with me thy heart in other place For there can live no hatred in thine eye Therefore in that I cannot know thy change In the false hearts history Is writ in and and strange But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell thy or thy hearts be Thy should nothing thence but sweetness tell How like apple thy beauty grow If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show They that have power to hurt and will do none That do not do the thing they most do show Who moving are themselves as stone Unmoved cold and to temptation slow They rightly do inherit heavens And husband riches from expense Tibey are the and of their but of their excellence The flower is to the summer sweet Though to it self it only live and die But if that flower with base infection meet The weed his dignity For turn by their that fester smell far worse than How sweet and lovely thou make the shame Which like a canker in the fragrant rose spot the beauty of thy budding name O in what thou thy enclose That tongue that the story of thy days Making lascivious on thy sport Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise Naming thy name an ill report O what a mansion have those got Which for their habitation chose out thee Where veil cover every blot And all turns to fair that can see Take heed dear heart of this large privilege The knife lose his edge Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport Both grace and are of more and less Thou that to thee resort As on the finger of a queen The jewel will be well So are those that in thee are seen To and for true How many might the stern wolf betray If like a lamb he could his translate How many thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state But do not so I love thee in such sort As thou being mine mine is thy good report How like a winter hath my absence been From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year What have I felt what dark days seen What old bareness everywhere And yet this time removed was time The teeming autumn big with rich increase Bearing the wanton burden of the prime Like widowed after their decease Yet this abundant issue to me But hope of and unfathered fruit For summer and his wait on thee And thou away the very are mute Or if they sing with so dull a cheer That leaves look pale the near From you have I been absent in the spring When dressed in all his trim Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing That heavy and with him Yet nor the of nor the sweet smell Of different in and in hue Could make me any story tell Or from their lap pluck them where they grew Nor did I wonder at the white Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose They were but sweet but of delight Drawn after you you pattern of all those Yet it winter still and you away As with your shadow I with these did play The forward violet thus did I chide Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that If not from my breath The purple pride Which on thy soft check for complexion In my thou too grossly The lily I condemned for thy hand And of marjoram had thy hair The fearfully on did stand One blushing shame another white despair A third nor red nor white had of both And to his robbery had thy breath But for his theft in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death More I noted yet I none could see But sweet or colour it had from thee Where art thou Muse that thou so long To speak of that which thee all thy might thou thy fury on some worthless song Darkening thy power to lend base light Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem In gentle time so idly spent Sing to the ear that thy esteem And thy pen both skill and argument Rise resty Muse my sweet face survey If time have any wrinkle graven there If any be a satire to decay And make times everywhere Give my love fame faster than Time life So thou his scythe and crooked knife O truant Muse what shall be thy amends For thy neglect of truth in beauty Both truth and beauty on my love So thou too and therein dignified Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed Beauty no pencil truth to lay But best is best if never Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb Excuse not silence so fort in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb And to be of yet to be Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how To make him seem long hence as he now My love is though more weak in seeming I love not less though less the show appear That love is whose rich The tongue publish every where Our love was new and then but in the spring When I was wont to greet it with my As Philomel in front sing And her pipe in growth of riper days Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful did hush the night But that wild music every bough And grown common lose their dear delight Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue Because I would not dull you with my song Alack what poverty my muse forth That such a scope to show her pride The argument all bare is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside O blame me not if I no more can write Look in your glass and there a face That my blunt invention quite my and doing me disgrace Were it not sinful then striving to mend To mar the subject that before was well For to no other pass my tend Than of your and your to tell And more much more than in my verse can sit Your own glass you when you look in it To me fair friend you never can be old For as you were when first your eye I eyed Such your beauty still three cold Have from the shook three pride Three beauteous to yellow autumn turned In process of the have I seen Three in three hot burned Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green Ah yet beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace So your sweet hue which methinks still stand Hath motion and mine eye may be For fear of which hear this thou age unbred Ere you were born was summer dead Let not my love be idolatry Nor my beloved as an idol show Since all alike my and be To one of one still such and ever so Kind is my love today tomorrow kind Still constant in a wondrous excellence Therefore my verse to constancy confined One thing leaves out difference Fair kind and true is all my argument Fair kind and true to other And in this change is my invention spent Three in one which wondrous scope Fair kind and true have often lived alone Which three till now never kept seat in one When in the chronicle of wasted time I see of the And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely Then in the blazon of sweet best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have expressed Even such a beauty as you master now So all their are but Of this our time all you And for they but with divining They had not skill enough your worth to sing For we which now behold these present days Have to wonder but lack to praise Not mine own nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world on to come Can yet the lease of my true love control Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom The mortal moon hath her eclipse And the sad mock their own presage now crown themselves assured And peace of endless age Now with the of this most balmy time My love fresh and death to me Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme While he oer dull and speechless And thou in this shalt find thy monument When and of brass are spent Whats in the brain that ink may character Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit Whats new to speak what now to register That may express my love or thy dear merit Nothing sweet boy but yet like divine I must each day say oer the very same Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name So that eternal love in fresh case not the dust and injury of age Nor to necessary place But antiquity for aye his page Finding the first conceit of love there bred Where time and outward form would show it dead O never say that I was false of heart Though absence my flame to qualify As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast lie That is my home of love if I have ranged Like him that I return again Just to the time not with the time So that my self bring water for my stain Never believe though in my nature All that besiege all of blood That it could so preposterously be To leave for nothing all thy sum of good For nothing this wide universe I call Save thou my rose in it thou art my all Alas true I have gone here and there And made my self a motley to the view mine own sold cheap what is most dear Made old of new Most true it is that I have on truth Askance and strangely but by all above These gave my heart another youth And worse proved thee my best of love Now all is done have what shall have no end Mine appetite I never more will grind On proof to try an older friend A god in love to whom I am confined Then give me welcome next my heaven the best Even to thy pure and most most loving breast O for my sake do you with Fortune chide The guilty goddess of my harmful That did not better for my life provide Than public which public manners Thence comes it that my name a brand And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in like the hand Pity me then and wish I were Whilst like a willing patient I will drink of gainst my strong infection No bitterness that I will bitter think Nor double penance to correct correction Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me Your love and pity th impression fill Which vulgar scandal upon my brow For what care I who me well or ill So you my bad my good allow You are my all the world and I must strive To know my and from your tongue None else to me nor I to none alive That my sense or right or wrong In so profound abysm I throw all care Of that my sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are Mark how with my neglect I do dispense You are so strongly in my purpose bred That all the world besides methinks are dead Since I left you mine eye is in my mind And that which me to go about part his function and is partly blind seeing but effectually is out For it no form to the heart Of bird of flower or shape which it latch Of his quick hath the mind no part Nor his own vision what it catch For if it see the or sight The most sweet or creature The mountain or the sea the day or night The crow or dove it them to your feature Incapable of more replete with you My most true mind thus mine untrue Or whether my mind being crowned with you Drink up the plague this flattery Or whether shall I say mine eye true And that your love taught it this alchemy To make of and Such as your sweet self resemble every bad a perfect best As fast as to his assemble O the first flattery in my seeing And my great mind most kingly it up Mine eye well what with his gust is And to his palate prepare the cup If it be the lesser sin That mine eye it and first begin Those that I before have writ do lie Even those that said I could not love you Yet then my judgment knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer But reckoning time whose millioned Creep in twixt and change of Tan sacred beauty blunt the Divert strong to the course of Alas why of times tyranny Might I not then say Now I love you best When I was certain oer the present doubting of the rest Love is a babe then might I not say so To give full growth to that which still grow Let me not to the marriage of true Admit love is not love Which when it alteration Or with the remover to remove O no it is an mark That on and is never shaken It is the star to every bark Whose unknown although his height be taken not Times fool though rosy and Within his bending compass come Love not with his brief and But it out even to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ nor no man ever Accuse me thus that I have all Wherein I should your great repay Forgot upon your love to call Whereto all do tie me day by day That I have frequent been with unknown And given to time your own right That I have sail to all the Which should transport me farthest from your sight Book both my and down And on just proof surmise accumulate Bring me within the level of your frown But shoot not at me in your hate Since my appeal I did strive to prove The constancy and virtue of your love Like as to make our appetite more keen With eager we our palate urge As to prevent our unseen We sicken to shun sickness when we purge Even so being full of your sweetness To bitter did I frame my feeding And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness To be diseased ere that there was true needing Thus policy in love t anticipate The that were not grew to assured And brought to medicine a healthful state Which rank of goodness would by ill be But thence I learn and find the lesson true poison him that so feil sick of you What have I drunk of Siren Distilled from foul as hell within to and to Still losing when I saw my self to win What wretched hath my heart Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never How have mine out of their been fitted In the distraction of this madding fever O benefit of ill now I find true That better is by evil still made better And ruined love when it is built anew fairer than at first more strong far greater So I return to my content And gain by thrice more than I have spent That you were once unkind me now And for that sorrow which I then did feel Needs must I under my transgression bow Unless my were brass or steel For if you were by my unkindness shaken As I by yours a hell of time And I a tyrant have no leisure taken To weigh how once I in your crime O that our night of woe might have My sense how hard true sorrow And soon to you as you to me then The humble salve which wounded But that your trespass now becomes a fee Mine yours and yours must ransom me better to be vile than vile When not to be reproach of being And the just pleasure lost which is so Not by our feeling but by seeing For why should false adulterate Give salutation to my sportive blood Or on my why are Which in their count bad what I think good No I am that I am and they that level At my reckon up their own I may be straight though they themselves be bevel By their rank my must not be shown Unless this general evil they maintain All men are bad and in their badness reign Thy gift thy tables are within my brain Full with lasting memory Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date even to eternity Or at the least so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist Till each to oblivion yield his part Of thee thy record never can be That poor retention could not so much hold Nor need I thy dear love to score Therefore to give them from me was I bold To trust those tables that receive thee more To keep an adjunct to remember thee Were to import forgetfulness in me No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change Thy built up with might To me are nothing novel nothing strange They are but Of a former sight Our are brief and therefore we admire What thou foist upon us that is old And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have them told Thy and thee I both defy Not at the present nor the past For thy and what we see lie Made more or less by thy continual haste This I do vow and this shall ever be I will be true despite thy scythe and thee If my dear love were but the child of state It might for bastard be unfathered As subject to times love or to times hate among or with No it was far from accident It not in smiling pomp nor Under the blow of discontent Whereto th inviting time our fashion It not policy that heretic Which works on of But all alone hugely politic That it nor with heat nor with To this I witness call the of time Which die for goodness who have lived for crime aught to me I bore the canopy With my extern the outward Or laid great bases for eternity Which more short than waste or Have I not seen on form and Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet simple savour Pitiful in their gazing spent No let me be obsequious in thy heart And take thou my oblation poor but free Which is not mixed with no art But mutual render only me for thee Hence thou informer a true soul When most least in thy control O thou my lovely boy who in thy power hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour Who by waning grown and therein Thy withering as thy sweet self If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack As thou onwards still will pluck thee back She thee to this purpose that her skill May time disgrace and wretched kill Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure She may detain but not still keep her treasure Her audit though must be And her quietus is to render thee In the old age black was not fair Or if it were it bore not name But now is black successive heir And beauty with a bastard shame For since each hand hath put on power Fairing the foul with false face Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower But is if not in disgrace Therefore my mistress are raven black Her so and they seem At such who not born fair no beauty lack Slandering creation with a false esteem Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe That every tongue beauty should look so How oft when thou my music music Upon that blessed wood whose motion With thy sweet when thou gently The wiry concord that mine ear Do I envy those that nimble leap To kiss the tender inward of thy hand Whilst my poor which should that harvest reap At the boldness by thee blushing stand To be so tickled they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips Oer whom thy walk with gentle gait Making dead wood more blest than living Since saucy so happy are in this Give them thy me thy to kiss Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action and till action lust Is perjured bloody full of blame Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust no sooner but straight Past reason and no sooner had Past reason as a bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad Mad in pursuit and in possession so Had and in quest to have extreme A bliss in proof and proved a very woe Before a joy behind a dream All this the world well yet none well To shun the heaven that men to this hell My mistress are nothing like the sun Coral is far more red than her red If snow be white why then her are dun If be black grow on her head I have seen red and white But no such see I in her And in some is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress I love to hear her speak yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound I grant I never saw a goddess go My mistress when she on the ground And yet by heaven I think my love as rare As any she with false compare Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art As those whose proudly make them cruel For well thou to my dear doting heart Thou art the and most precious jewel Yet in good faith some say that thee behold Thy face hath not the power to make love groan To say they err I dare not be so bold Although I swear it to my self alone And to be sure that is not false I swear A thousand but thinking on thy face One on neck do witness bear Thy black is in my place In nothing art thou black save in thy And thence this slander as I think proceeds Thine I love and they as pitying me Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain Have put on black and loving be Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey of the east Nor that full star that in the even half that glory to the sober west As those two mourning become thy face O let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me since mourning thee grace And suit thy pity like in every part Then will I swear beauty herself is black And all they foul that thy complexion lack Beshrew that heart that my heart to groan For that deep wound it my friend and me Ist not enough to torture me alone But slave to slavery my friend must be Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken And my next self thou harder engrossed Of him my self and thee I am forsaken A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed Prison my heart in thy steel ward But then my heart let my poor heart bail me let my heart be his guard Thou not then use in my gaol And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee Perforce am thine and all that is in me So now I have that he is thine And I my self am to thy will My self Ill forfeit so that other mine Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still But thou wilt not nor he will not be free For thou art covetous and he is kind He learned but to write for me Under that bond that him as fist bind The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take Thou usurer that forth all to use And sue a friend came debtor for my sake So him I lose through my unkind abuse Him have I lost thou both him and me He the whole and yet am I not free Whoever hath her wish thou thy will And Will to boot and Will in overplus More than enough am I that vex thee still To thy sweet will making addition thus Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine Shall will in seem right gracious And in my will no fair acceptance shine The sea all water yet rain still And in abundance to his store So thou being rich in will add to thy will One will of mine to make thy large will more Let no unkind no fair kill Think all but one and me in that one Will If thy soul check thee that I come so near Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will And will thy soul is admitted there Thus far for love my sweet Will will the treasure of thy love Ay fill it full with and my will one In of great receipt with case we prove Among a number one is none Then in the number let me pass untold Though in thy account I one must be For nothing hold me so it please thee hold That nothing me a something sweet to thee Make but my name thy love and love that still And then thou me for my name is Will Thou blind fool Love what thou to mine That they behold and see not what they see They know what beauty is see where it Yet what the best is take the worst to be If corrupt by overpartial Be anchored in the bay where all men ride Why of falsehood thou forged Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied Why should my heart think that a several plot Which my heart the wide common place Or mine seeing this say this is not To put fair truth upon so foul a face In right true my heart and have And to this false plague are they now transferred When my love that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she That she might think me some untutored youth Unlearned in the false Thus vainly thinking that she me young Although she my days are past the best Simply I credit her tongue On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed But wherefore she not she is unjust And wherefore say not I that I am old O best habit is in seeming trust And age in love not to have told Therefore I lie with her and she with me And in our by we be O call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness upon my heart Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue Use power with power and slay me not by art Tell me thou elsewhere but in my sight Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside What thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my defence can bide Let me excuse thee ah my love well Her pretty have been mine And therefore from my face she turns my That they elsewhere might dart their Yet do not so but since I am near slain Kill me outright with and rid my pain Be wise as thou art cruel do not press My patience with too much disdain Lest sorrow lend me and express The manner of my pain If I might teach thee wit better it were Though not to love yet love to tell me so As testy sick men when their be near No news but health from their know For if I should despair I should grow mad And in my madness might speak ill of thee Now this world is grown so bad Mad by mad be That I may not be so nor thou Bear thine straight though thy heart go wide In faith I do not love thee with mine For they in thee a thousand note But my heart that what they despise Who in despite of view is to dote Nor are mine with thy tune delighted Nor tender feeling to base prone Nor taste nor smell desire to be To any sensual feast with thee alone But my five nor my five can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man Thy hearts slave and vassal wretch to be Only my plague thus far I count my gain That she that me sin me pain Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving O but with mine compare thou thine own state And thou shalt find it not Or if it do not from those of thine That have their scarlet And sealed false of love as oft as mine of their Be it lawful I love thee as thou those Whom thine woo as mine importune thee Root pity in thy heart that when it Thy pity may deserve to be If thou seek to have what thou hide By thou be Lo as a careful to catch One of her feathered broke away down her babe and all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay Whilst her child her in chase to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which before her face Not her poor discontent So thou after that which from thee Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me And play the part kiss me be kind So will I pray that thou have thy Will If thou turn back and my loud crying still Two I have of comfort and despair Which like two do suggest me still The better angel is a man right fair The worser spirit a woman ill To win me soon to hell my female evil my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her foul pride And whether that my angel be turned fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell But being both from me both to each friend I guess one angel in hell Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt Till my bad angel fire my good one out Those that own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said I hate To me that for her sake But when she saw my woeful state Straight in her heart did mercy come Chiding that tongue that ever sweet Was used in giving gentle doom And taught it thus anew to greet I hate she with an end That it as gentle day follow night who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away I hate from hate away she threw And saved my life saying not you Poor soul the of my sinful earth My sinful earth these rebel array Why thou pine within and suffer dearth Painting thy outward so costly gay Why so large cost so short a lease thou upon thy fading mansion spend Shall of this excess Eat up thy charge is this thy end Then soul live thou upon thy loss And let that pine to aggravate thy store Buy divine in selling of dross Within be fed without be rich no more So shall thou feed on death that on men And death once dead theres no more dying then My love is as a fever longing still For that which longer the disease Feeding on that which preserve the ill Th uncertain sickly appetite to please My reason the physician to my love Angry that his are not kept Hath left me and I desperate now approve Desire is death which physic did except Past cure I am now reason is past care And with evermore unrest My and my discourse as mad are At random from the truth vainly expressed For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright Who art as black as hell as dark as night O me what hath love put in my head Which have no correspondence with true sight Or if they have where is my judgment fled That falsely what they see aright If that be fair whereon my false dote What the world to say it is not so If it be not then love well denote eye is not so true as all no How can it O how can eye be true That is so vexed with watching and with No marvel then though I mistake my view The sun it self not till heaven O cunning love with thou me blind Lest thy foul should find thou O cruel say I love thee not When I against my self with thee partake Do I not think on thee when I forgot Am of my self for thy sake Who thee that I do call my friend On whom thou that I do fawn upon Nay if thou on me do I not spend Revenge upon my self with present moan What merit do I in my self respect That is so thy service to despise When all my best worship thy defect by the motion of thine But love hate on for now I know thy mind Those that can see thou and I am blind O from what power thou this powerful might With insufficiency my heart to sway To make me give the lie to my true sight And swear that brightness not grace the day Whence thou this becoming of ill That in the very refuse of thy There is such strength and warrantise of skill That in my mind thy worst all best Who taught thee how to make me love thee more The more I hear and see just cause of hate O though I love what do abhor With thou not abhor my state If thy unworthiness raised love in me More worthy I to be beloved of thee Love is too young to know what conscience is Yet who not conscience is born of love Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss Lest guilty of my thy sweet self prove For thou me I do betray My part to my gross treason My soul tell my body that he may Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason But rising at thy name point out thee As his triumphant prize of this pride He is contented thy poor drudge to be To stand in thy fall by thy side No want of conscience hold it that I call Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall In loving thee thou I am forsworn But thou art twice forsworn to me love In act thy broke and new faith torn In new hate after new love bearing But why of two breach do I accuse thee When I break twenty I am perjured most For all my are but to misuse thee And all my honest faith in thee is lost For I have sworn deep of thy deep kindness of thy love thy truth thy constancy And to enlighten thee gave to blindness Or made them swear against the thing they see For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I To swear against the truth so foul a be laid by his brand and fell asleep A maid of this advantage found And his fire did quickly steep In a cold of that ground Which from this holy fire of Love A dateless lively heat still to endure And grew a bath which yet men prove Against strange a sovereign cure But at my mistress eye brand The boy for trial needs would touch my breast I sick withal the help of bath desired And thither a sad distempered guest But found no cure the bath for my help Where got new fire my mistress The little lying once asleep Laid by his side his brand Whilst many that vowed chaste life to keep Came tripping by but in her maiden hand The votary took up that fire Which many of true hearts had warmed And so the general of hot desire Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed This brand she in a cool well by Which from fire took heat perpetual Growing a bath and healthful remedy For men but I my mistress thrall Came there for cure and this by that I prove fire water water not love THE END\n",
